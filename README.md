# homelab-vm-initramfs-fix
Troubleshooting a VM boot failure on ESXi due to a missing initramfs file. I resolved an issue in my homelab where a virtual machine running on VMware ESXi failed to boot because the initramfs file was missing. This caused the system to drop into emergency mode and prevented it from loading the operating system.
