# Homelab Project: Fixing a VM Boot Failure (Missing initramfs on ESXi)

This project documents how I troubleshooted and resolved a VM boot issue in my **homelab** on **VMware ESXi** caused by a missing **initramfs file**.

---

## ðŸ”Ž Problem
When the VM was powered on, it dropped into **initramfs emergency mode** and could not boot the OS.  

**What is initramfs?**  
Initramfs (Initial RAM File System) is a temporary root filesystem loaded into memory during boot. It contains essential drivers, kernel modules, and tools needed to mount the actual root filesystem. If itâ€™s missing or corrupted, the system cannot boot.

---

### ðŸ›  Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Accessed the VM via ESXi Console**
   - Rebooted the VM, interrupted GRUB, and selected the **Rescue Kernel**.
   - Pressed **Enter** to boot into rescue mode.

2. **Checked Logs for Errors**
   ```bash
   tail -20 /var/log/messages

3. **Investigated, Rebuilt, and Rebooted

Inside the /boot directory, I discovered that the main initramfs file was missing, but a backup existed.
I then rebuilt the initramfs using dracut and rebooted the VM.

cd /boot
ls -l
dracut initramfs-<kernel_version>.img <kernel_version>
reboot

## ðŸ“Œ Lessons Learned

Understanding the Linux boot process (GRUB, kernel, initramfs) is crucial for system administrators.
dracut is a powerful tool for rebuilding initramfs and recovering from boot issues.
Practicing in a homelab environment helps sharpen real-world troubleshooting skills.
